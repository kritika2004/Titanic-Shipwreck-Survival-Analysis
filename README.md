# Titanic Shipwreck Survival Analysis
  This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to train a random forest classifier, predicting passenger survival, and integrates MLflow for efficient experiment tracking and model management.
  
# Description 
In this code, I worked with the Titanic dataset to predict whether passengers survived or not. I cleaned up the data, handled missing values in the age column, and did some exploratory analysis. I then trained a machine learning model, specifically a random forest classifier, to make predictions. The model performed well, achieving around 78% accuracy on new data. To better manage my machine learning workflow, I integrated MLflow, which helps me keep track of different model runs, log important parameters and metrics, and makes it easier to collaborate on model development. This way, I have a more organized and reproducible approach to building and evaluating machine learning models.
